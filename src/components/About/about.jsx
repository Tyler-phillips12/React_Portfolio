         Hello, my name is Tyler Phillips and welcome to my portfolio! I am
         excited to tell you all about who I am and why I decided to learn web
         development. I recently decided to pivot into the tech industry for I
         wanted to seek out a challenge that would place me outside my comfort
         zone. I love to be creative and watch my project's come to life from
         start to finish. I spent about 6 years and am still currently writing
         and recording music. Some of my hobbies include: PC gaming, Song
         writing, Anything outdoors, antique shopping, and playing guitar just
         to name a few! I look forward to expanding on my knowledge throughout
         this course and ultimately carry what I learn here into the work
         field.
